During the covid-19 pandemic, I decided to accept a travel nursing assignment in Boston. Charles and Amy were way more accommodating than necessary. They worked with me on the length of the stay, payment options and navigating AirBnB's front-line workers discount. The home is located very close to Faulkner hospital and within walking distance of the T. On the note of transportation, the attached garage is absolutely fantastic. Not having to worry about finding a spot to park has been really great. And as for the home itself, it's beautiful and sparkling clean! We stayed primarily in the basement (to minimize me inadvertently contaminating anything) and were very comfortable there. The queen sized bed is super comfy (no back issues at all!), with a ton of linen and pillows available. The basement also boasts a sofa, nice sized television, a clothing rack, lamps and a bathroom, along with welcoming decorations. Just upstairs is the cute and comfy living room (with plenty of lap blankets to snuggle in!), a cozy fireplace, another large television, and a beautiful and well stocked kitchen. One more set of stairs and you'll find the full size washer and dryer (with soap available), and equally well stocked bathroom (and more bedrooms, though we didn't use these). I haven't had time, but they've also got a grill in the backyard that I hope to fire up before we leave. Lastly, communication was FANTASTIC. Amy is so welcoming and helpful. She answered my messages and texts immediately, checked in on us regularly, and was so hospitable! We really felt at home and are way more grateful to Charles and Amy than I could begin to convey!

It's within a very short walking distance (less than 5 mins) to several great restaurants and the home itself is very cute. The unit occupies the entire second floor of the home and the layout was perfect for our needs. Irida was not in town that night but we were greeted by her very sweet mother who lives on the first floor of the home. 

When you first enter you go up the stairs to the second floor and the first bedroom is at the top of the stairs just at the entrance to the rest of the unit, my mom slept there. My husband and I took the master bedroom so our son could stay in the pack & play we brought with us and we shared a bathroom with the front bedroom. The third bedroom had its own private bathroom and a door that shut the bathroom and bedroom off from the rest of the unit which was perfect for my elderly grandfather who needs some privacy for the bathroom/medical reasons. My favorite part was that it had several doors that could be shut to close off certain areas of the unit which was perfect for my newly walking and very curious toddler.

South Boston caught our attention because it seemed to offer everything: easy access to the city center, beaches and authentic Boston culture. With that in mind, we started looking for accommodations that matched our expectations of South Boston. This luxury private home is just that: an entire house in the tradition of South Boston's famous walk-up brownstones loaded with all new amenities. Seriously, it looks and feels like it was just built. Super clean, super modern with just about the most comfortable beds one could sleep in. The large television, refrigerator, dishwasher, washer and dryer, even the garbage disposal are all top of the line. There are separate central air-conditioning-heating controls for the first and second floors, which was very much appreciated by us as Boston can get both really hot and humid. Each of the three bedrooms have big, comfortable beds. The first and second floors both have their own bathrooms with full showers. Another huge plus is the garage. It's very large, automatic and secure. Given that parking in Boston is challenging at best, this is worth gold. There are two decks on the back of the house off the first and second floors which were quite nice. However, we didn't use them much because of the next point: location. This house has a perfect location! It's literally in the middle of everything, but one has total privacy. The neighborhood is very family oriented with lots of restaurants, shops and a couple of big supermarkets. Joseph's Bakery/Joseph's Deli is one such great local place with homemade everything! A ten minute walk will get you to the M Street Beach, which is large, clean and frequented by locals. A ten minute walk will also get you to a bus that takes you directly to the center of Boston, including the subway connections at Downtown Crossing to wherever you need to go. Shelby was super helpful with many suggestions as to where to go and what to see. So many in fact, we couldn't get to most of them because we discovered so many things here ourselves! Shelby was also super fast with communication and answering any questions we had, which also helped us a great deal and saved us time. In all honesty, one could not ask for more. As a side note, check-in and check-out are dead simple. Everything is covered and the location is just awesome.

The place is a little hard to find, but Eddie (the person who was going to give us our keys) directed us to the right place.  The building itself is a bit run-down and smells like smoke in the stair well and hallways.  There is also no elevator, but the 3rd floor isn't too bad as long as your luggage isn't too heavy.  The room itself is very well decorated and home-y.  The bed was definitely comfortable and having a fridge was convenient.  The bathroom is definitely old, and had some hair and a few pieces of broken glass on the floor which threw me off a little, but my boyfriend and I got over it pretty quickly.  The location of this place is really the selling point!  Being so close to a T station makes getting around the entire city a breeze!

Walking out of Logan, you can just jump on to any airport shuttle and get off at Airport station of subway, which is typically less than 5min drive. After you get off the shuttle, you need to walk into the subway station and get over the bridge in the station to the other side of the tracks. You then exit the station into the park outside of the station. There are always some police cars in the park, so it makes you feel safe even in the evening. from there it’s simply one short block away from the park. Total walking distance is less than 5min. Btw, you don’t need to buy ticket to walk over the bridge in the subway station. I stay here with a friend for the marathon, and it is pretty easy to go from here to all places before and after the race simply by subway.

Communication was first rate, before booking,  not a question went unanswered for more than ten minutes (really).  After booking, all instructions were clear and accurate.
The location, the home, the suite we occupied were just perfect.
The neighborhood is ""just right!""  Not too busy, not too quiet, and located just minutes from our daughter (walking).
Antoinette and Louis are like magical hosts, there and not there......how do they DO that??!! 
They were out when we arrived (a late dinner time arrival) but we knew how to let ourselves in.  Once settled, there was wine in the fridge and wine glasses to choose from! 
All weekend we were in and out of this gorgeous, immaculately kept home, shoes off (in well designated places) and so very comfy up on our own third floor.
The temperature dropped 30 degrees our second day, I was ill prepared....and without a moment of hesitation, Antoinette handed me two jackets (we DO love choices, don't we?) and a cozy scarf.  Oh My Gosh, it made all the difference on a blustery, damp day.  So, so appreciate this kindness.
Morning coffee was all we NEEDED, (fresh beans, grinder, french press, ahhhhhh), but we also couldn't resist the fresh bread (I used butter AND pear preserves).
The yard was coming to life and it's obvious that Antoinette and Louis care for it (Website hidden by Airbnb) fact, the whole neighborhood was popping with spring beauty.  Sorry to miss the lilacs (just starting), azaleas and rhododendrons!  
Great walking area!  Shops of many kinds, the Arnold Arboretum (which we WILL see next time!).
We were astonished at the class of this home and at the generosity of Antoinette and Louis for sharing it!

We are a local family of three (plus a dog!) who needed to vacate our home while work was being done, so we were very familiar with the neighborhood.  The home is super conveniently located (.5 miles to the subway) and across from the gorgeous Franklin Park.  The unit itself is immaculate!  I am really particular about cleanliness and am always nervous when staying in an AirBNB but Josh's unit was perfect.  Basically brand new!  The have a beautiful, fenced in yard, which was great for our dog. The family lives in the main house upstairs but we never saw them.  Check in/out was (Website hidden by Airbnb) easy as coming home would be.  Unit was stocked with all the things we needed (shampoo, soap, hair dryer, etc) and had an in unit laundry which was great for when we had to extend our stay for an extra day.  Josh was quick to respond to me when I requested another night. 

All in all, this is a great place to stay for a family of 3 or perhaps 4.  We will definitely refer any visiting friend's to Josh's unit.  One thing I would like to point out, which didn't bother us in the least, but for those who can't stand the noise of upstairs neighbors, please know this is a basement unit and you can hear people walking above.","Luxury pet-friendly 2 bed by beautiful park!",314576,"Josh",NA,"Jamaica Plain",42.31086,-71.09922,"Entire home/apt",124,29,162,"2/5/2021",2.88,1,139,"E13",235,0.218014663751232,0.283733417687788,"doc365",18,24,21,22,9,25,1,40,6,11,26,9,34,3,0,29,1,5214

We initially liked the apartment a lot, but over our stay there were several issues that emerged and on top of that, we were extremely disappointed at how unresponsive and dismissive Thatch was to a lot of our concerns. The shower had about 2 minutes of hot water and then would cycle in between hot and ice cold for the remainder of the shower, the AC would shut off at random even though the temperature in the room was well above the set temp, and the WiFi would occasionally drop off- which was extremely disruptive to our work from home situation. The most major issue that emerged was the presence of mice in the kitchen. We immediately tried to call the emergency maintenance line, which we found doesn't actually exist. When Thatch responded to our email the next morning, they said that this was a ""common problem"" and that they had known about it for quite some time, despite not giving us any warning or putting traps in our apartment. Overall, we were very disappointed with the lack of responsiveness from Thatch as well as the issues that were not advertised or resolved in a timely manner.

We circled every time for a long time to find anything and the public parking “2 blocks away” means that every time you move your car means that you have to pay again ($41 per day or $23 for a few hours). Yes, there are antiques in the Airbnb, but the kitchen had dirty drawers, the dishes in the dishwasher had something fuzzy on the silverware that I did not want to discover further. After taking stock we decided to eat all meals elsewhere other than coffee in the morning. We have stayed in many Airbnb in this price category ($1,032 for 3 nights) and we have never found absolutely nothing there to make us feel welcome: a coffee maker and no coffee, a tea kettle and no tea, no paper towels, no rag to clean a table, no shampoo or sugar for your coffee or salt and pepper for eggs or any other welcoming touch such as bottled water or a note with local restaurants. Yet the rule to NOT turn the heat up because “heating bill is very expensive” and to turn down the heat when leaving for a few hours. This was not a comfortable stay. Oh and we ran out of toilet paper as well. We used napkins that were provided. There is a very charming garden that would be nice during warmer weather when it is cleaned up and useable.

This neighborhood is simply beautiful. Close to the Auboretum; close to Jamaica Pond. 

This unit is two very large, airy rooms combined into one, with a very comfortable (firm) poster queen bed, multiple dressers, an oversized couch, a settee and a formal dining table with four chairs. You’ll find a sink, microwave, refrigerator, coffee maker, hot plate and dishes, so you can prepare simple meals with ease. Lots of windows look out over the lovely neighborhood. A ceiling fan and an air conditioner keep it cool in hot weather. 

The bathroom is charming and spacious with a modern dual-headed shower. Believe it or not….there is a washer and dryer too. 

Jil, the host, is wonderful. She lives downstairs and is immediately responsive to any needs her guests have. A long-time resident of JP, she can give lots of tips about fun things to do in the area. 

I meant to stay a few weeks, but stayed two months. I can’t wait to go back. And, Jil has properties on the Cape….I’ll be heading here soon too.   : )

It's in a cute, historic area of Boston with bars, restaurants, and some shops just down the street so you feel more like a local and less like a tourist. A lot of tourist attractions are 10-20 minute car rides away. I recommend walking literally across the street to Dorchester Heights National Historic Site for the history as well as a lovely view of the city. Kevin and Diane have a private basement with a separate entrance so it's like having you're own place. The bed was very comfortable, and even the cot I stayed on one night while friends were in town was comfortable. There was a space heater available in order to adjust the temperature, a keurig coffee machine with supplies, as well as wifi. When I arrived it was snowing out. Kevin reached out and stayed in touch so that he could salt the entrance prior to my arrival. They were wonderful hosts that were easy to contact, communicated clearly, and made sure you had everything you needed!

The bathroom was clean, as were the linens & extra towels. There was an iron, which was also a plus.  You use a code to get in, so I was sure to lock the deadbolt when in the apartment, as I'm not sure how often those change.  I reported a slight issue (power outage) one of the nights, and didn't hear anything back, but it didn't impact me massively, since it came back on relatively soon after.

I had gone by only the Reviews when confirming and am so glad that I did! The feedback that I read was all that I experienced in my one month stay in September ! Laura was the perfect host, ensuring comfort at all times including loaning an air mattress when my son was visiting; a blender from her own personal kitchen to prepare my Indian meals for my son; etc. The place is so central and the time flew by very quickly! Apartment is super clean with good linen and kitchen items. Perhaps the 2 things Laura could add to make it perfect is a chest of drawers as there is no proper closet to organize personal clothes and fix the window curtains in the room.

It is extremely clean, the bathroom/shower is great and it has all of the amenities that you would need. They even left us some yogurts and OJ in the fridge as well as throw away toothbrushes in the bathroom! 

The self-check in and check out is extremely easy (you get sent a code for the front door) which takes all of the stress away when running to our from Logan like we were! While we only briefly met Lisa and Kathe in the hallway, their communication was excellent, answering any questions we had within a couple of hours. They even gave us a recommendation for where to eat in the North End given the volume of Italian restaurants in that part of town! They allowed us to leave our bags in a different room for the day when we checked out as our flight was not until 7:30pm that evening which was also much appreciated.

The location is very good - The South End is lovely (classic Boston red-brick neighborhood) and the apartment is literally a 1 minute walk to Tremont Street which has a catalog of excellent restaurants. It took us about 10 minutes to walk to Back Bay T station, the heart of Back Bay (Boylston St/Newbury St/Commenwealth Ave.) and Boston Common so it is well located for all of the major tourist sites.

The accommodations were nice, and it's clear that Jon and Margrit put in the effort to renovate/decorate for a modern and comfortable stay. Jon and Margrit were also very accommodating in allowing us to pick up the keys earlier and drop off our bags, as well as allow our parents to stay when their flights got cancelled due to the weather. Although we didn't stay for this, Jon and Margrit did leave a nice continental breakfast for their guests, which included bagels/toast, fruit, coffee and orange juice.

After we made the room reservation, he sent to us a message through the Airbnb application and welcomed us and wrote us suggestions of different places that we could visit in Boston. He always kept communication with us, and he replied our messages quickly. 

The check in process was very easy. Eder gave us clearly instructions of the check in process. The house has 3 floors. To enter to the house you will have a code. Then you will go to your floor. In our case was the third floor. Then you will find the keys in a safe deposit box. You have to enter the code that Eder will give to you and you will find your keys inside the box. You will use those keys to enter to the house and also to your room. 

The house was excellent! It looks exactly how you look it in the pictures in the Airbnb application. The house was always very clean. There are two bathrooms which look great and are very clean. There is hot water, toilet paper, and towels. The kitchen is very nice, clean and equipped with everything that you need to cook. Also there is a coffee maker and free coffee. 

The room was beautiful and clean! The bed is very comfortable. There are others rooms in the house. In those rooms will be others guests. Our experience with the other guests was great. Everyone was very friendly. 

The house is close to the Savin Hill Station. It is around 10-12 minutes walking.  We always used the train but we retuned to the house in UBER. This is because we return to the house very late. Also there is a small market in front of the house, which is very convenient because you can buy things to eat.
